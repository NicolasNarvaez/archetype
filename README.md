ItÂ´s a work in progress(almost done), but, next aditions include, plugin support, node-graph-like visualizations structure, graphical node-based visualizations maker, run-time visualizacions mergeing, randomization, and random visualizations mixin. My primary goal is to create a milkdrop-like environment for sharing visualizations, able to run everywhere, with good resourche usage, and evolve the milkdrop layer system into a node based system with new capabilities (merge another viz into current, multiple post-shader and post-merge canvas for more complex efects with diferent motion ecuations, etc).
