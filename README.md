(Copy-paste a soundcloud url or just hit play ('cargar') )
In the example, you can select the source, a file(archivo), or the microphone (micrófono), the app is in spanish because im from chile! :3, next time there will be more effort on translations.

It´s a work in progress(almost done), but, next aditions include, plugin support, node-graph-like visualizations structure, graphical node-based visualizations maker, run-time visualizacions mergeing, randomization, and random visualizations mixin. My primary goal is to create a milkdrop-like environment for sharing visualizations, able to run everywhere, with good resourche usage, and evolve the milkdrop layer system into a node based system with new capabilities (merge another viz into current, multiple post-shader and post-merge canvas for more complex efects with diferent motion ecuations, etc).
